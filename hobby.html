    <h1> Welcome to My Hobby</h1>

    <p>HI! The reader.My name is Sirikalaya Siripattarakul. I grow up in a small town in Bangkok.</p>
    <p>I have many hobbies in my life such as collecting stamps, playing basketball, reading and so on. But now when I
        move to study n the USA. I change my hobby that I can do it.</p>

    <p>My hobby is cooking now. I learn to cook from Youtube and ask my friend if they cook. Why because when I came
        here any Thai restaurant will adapt tests for American people.</p>
    <p>It is not a real test same in Thailand so that is why I like to cook. Although before I don't like to cook in
        Thailand.</p>

    <p> It has many questions for my friend. Like how can you do that? Before I told you I don't like to cook but now
        it's my favorite hobby.
        How can I start it? First thing I make the easy food that I want to eat. Don't think like I make a fried egg.
        LOL
        The first thing that I make. Can you guess the Thai food I gonna make it? It fried rice with shrimp. </p>
    <h2>How can I make it?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Find the recipe. And watch how the chef can make it? You can search on the internet or youtube.</li>
        <li> Write the recipe that you want to use. Then let go to the market by the recipe.
        <li>Just make it. It is not hard. You can open youtube and you make it together with the chef on youtube. If you
            are still confused when you watch on youtube that chef makes the food. Just re-wind it again or ask a friend
            to cook Thai food.</li>
    </ol>
